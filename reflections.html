    <div class="row">
      <p>In this essay on ethics, I was asked to answer the following questions:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><small>What is the purpose of having/following a "Code of Ethics"?</small></p>
        <p><small>When you are faced with an ethical situation, how do you, personally, go about making a decision?  What factors are involved in making your decision?  Be specific!</small></p>
        <p><small>What case study was discussed in your small group?  How did the ethical considerations introduced by your group members differ from your own?  How were they alike?  Was your group able to come to a consensus on what the most "ethical" decision would be?</small></p>
        <p><small>Reflect on the "Virtue of Ethics" as it relates to the case study your group discussed.  Choose three of the six virtues that you feel are most related to your case study and briefly write about them.  Why did you choose the three you did?  How are they relevant to the case study?  Why are the other virtues less relevant?  Is there another ethical virtue you feel could apply to your case study that is NOT included in the "Virtue of Ethics?"  Why or why not?</small></p>
