          In this group project, we created an application that would allow
          users create groups, enroll people in those groups, and keep track
          of members in the groups. The main twist of this project was that it
          had the feature of face recognition. You enrolled someone in your selected group
          by uploading a picture of them (along with some other basic information).
          Now the app can recognize a new picture of that person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The primary function of this app is for educational purposes. The
          group owner can see all the people in his group, refresh his/her memory
          by seeing a picture of them, and can leave notes on that person.
        </p>


        <p>
          A secondary function of this app would include attendance tracking.
          At the beginning of a semester, the instructor could pass around some type
          of tablet and have each student take a picture of themselves and upload it
          to the app. Then, each day, the instructor could pass around his tablet
          and have each student take a picture of themselves. If they were recognized,
          their "time last seen" would be updated to the current time.

        <h2>NodeJS Chat <small class="text-muted">Created in SE 319</small></h2>

        <p>
          In this project, I was exploring the use of the JavaScript library,
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. Node is great for
          creating very fast, responsive web applications.
          One of the most common things to do in experimenting with Node is to
          create some sort of chat room. That is exactly what I did - I created
          a chat service. This service allows users to create public, private,
          and 1-1 chat rooms where they can chat with other friends or users
          of the application. A cool feature is that you can very quickly see
          when other users of the room are typing a message. Also, you can
          see what users are active in a given room.

      <h2>Wiki Crawler <small class="text-muted">Created in ComS 311</small></h2>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          In this project, I created an application that would
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawl</a>
          through wikipedia. The purpose of this crawling was to create a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph</a>
          representation of the wiki pages. The application starts by
          receiving a seed url (extention from the wikipedia base url). From
          there, it begins crawling the seed url page, until the number of links
          collected have reached some pre-determined limit. After receiving all
          of these links (represented as vertices on the graph), the application
          then began constructing edges between the vertices. The following is
          the output graph when calling <code>new WikiCrawler("/wiki/Computer_Science", 1000, "WikiCS.txt")</code>,
          where "/wiki/Computer_Science" is the seed url, 1000 is the total number of
          <i>new</i> vertices to fetch, and "WikiCS.txt" is the output file.
          Each line is a vertex pair. That means that the item on the left side
          of the column is connected to the item on the right side of the column.
          Here is the output file:
