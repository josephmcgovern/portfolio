        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>
            Our senior design project is underway right now. We are in the
            designing phase. We have not written any code yet for this project.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are going to be working on a product called
            <a href='https://cattlekrush.weebly.com/'>Cattle Krush</a>. This is
            a product used in the agriculture industry to convey real-time data
            to cattle-owners about the best time to buy and sell cattle. The
            goal of this application is to alert cattle-owners when the best
            time to sell their cattle is so that they can make a profit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where do we come in? Well, this company has had a hard time getting
            an application on the App Store. Our job is to create a cross-platform
            (iOS, Android, and web) application that has the same functionality
            as the existing application.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this point in the design, we believe that we will be using
            <a href='https://www.nativescript.org/'>NativeScript</a> as our
            cross-platform framework.
          </p>

          <p>
            Oddly enough, I love refactoring and cleaning up code. There is
            great satisfaction in writing code that is easy to understand. I
            am looking forward to this project because we will be refactoring
            and cleaning up the current code. I have no previous experience
            in NativeScript, so I am looking forward to learning how to
            interact with this framework.

    <!--  START BUDGETER -->
    <div class="row">
      <a name="budgeter"></a>
      <h2>Budgeter <small class="text-muted">Created in SE 329</small></h2>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          In this group project, we created a web application that did budget
          tracking and handling. You would have some initial income for your
          "budget term" (or pay period) and would create different categories
          that would split that money up. For example, you could have a food category,
          a clothes category, and a bills category. Expenses would be added to those
          categories. This application let you easily track how your money was spent.
          This same purpose could probably be acheived with an Excel-like application.
          However, this application has a much friendlier UI and is built to
          track budgets.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes this application distinct from a spreadsheet is that it
          can read receipts. You can upload an image of a receipt, and it will
          read the contents of the receipt, and build out an expense with the
          information it found about the various purchases listed on the receipt.
          This is nice because the user does not have to input every detail of
          a receipt. Instead, he or she can take a quick photo of their receipt and
          have the contents be added to their budget.
        </p>

        <p>
          To extract the words from the receipt, we connected with a service
          called <a href='https://ocr.space/'>OCR.Space</a>. This would search
          the image we supplied it for words and give those words back to us.
          This service helped us a lot with getting words from an image. It was
          also our limiting factor. This service would not always give us all
          of the words on the receipt (which means we can't list every puchased item),
          and it would also not correctly read words (lots of misspells). To
          get around the misspells, we used
          <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-spell-check-api'>
            Bing Spell Check API
          </a>
          to autocorrect the words that we received from the OCR
          (Optical Character Recognition) API.
        </p>

        <p>
          This application was written in Java, running on
          <a href='https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs'>Google App Engine</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our demos for this application are split up into two parts:

    <!--  START FACE RECOGNITION -->
    <div class="row">
      <a name="face-recongition"></a>
      <h2>Face Recognition <small class="text-muted">Created in SE 329</small></h2>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          In this group project, we created an application that would allow
          users create groups, enroll people in those groups, and keep track
          of members in the groups. The main twist of this project was that it
          had the feature of face recognition. You enrolled someone in your selected group
          by uploading a picture of them (along with some other basic information).
          Now the app can recognize a new picture of that person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The primary function of this app is for educational purposes. The
          group owner can see all the people in his group, refresh his/her memory
          by seeing a picture of them, and can leave notes on that person.
        </p>


        <p>
          A secondary function of this app would include attendance tracking.
          At the beginning of a semester, the instructor could pass around some type
          of tablet and have each student take a picture of themselves and upload it
          to the app. Then, each day, the instructor could pass around his tablet
          and have each student take a picture of themselves. If they were recognized,
          their "time last seen" would be updated to the current time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This application was written in Java, built to run
          on <a href='https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs'>Google App Engine</a>.
          We used servlets for all of our request handling. Detecting faces in an
          image and recognizing them was handled by a service that we connected
          with via API called <a href='https://www.kairos.com/'>Kairos</a>.
          This service alleviated a lot of the workload by doing all of the
          heavy lifting in detecting and recognizing faces.

        <p>
          In this project, I was exploring the use of the JavaScript library,
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. Node is great for
          creating very fast, responsive web applications.
          One of the most common things to do in experimenting with Node is to
          create some sort of chat room. That is exactly what I did - I created
          a chat service. This service allows users to create public, private,
          and 1-1 chat rooms where they can chat with other friends or users
          of the application. A cool feature is that you can very quickly see
          when other users of the room are typing a message. Also, you can
          see what users are active in a given room.

    <!--  START WIKI CRAWLER -->
    <div class="row">
      <a name="wiki-crawler"></a>
      <h2>Wiki Crawler <small class="text-muted">Created in ComS 311</small></h2>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          In this project, I created an application that would
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawl</a>
          through wikipedia. The purpose of this crawling was to create a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph</a>
          representation of the wiki pages. The application starts by
          receiving a seed url (extention from the wikipedia base url). From
          there, it begins crawling the seed url page, until the number of links
          collected have reached some pre-determined limit. After receiving all
          of these links (represented as vertices on the graph), the application
          then began constructing edges between the vertices. The following is
          the output graph when calling <code>new WikiCrawler("/wiki/Computer_Science", 1000, "WikiCS.txt")</code>,
          where "/wiki/Computer_Science" is the seed url, 1000 is the total number of
          <i>new</i> vertices to fetch, and "WikiCS.txt" is the output file.
          Each line is a vertex pair. That means that the item on the left side
          of the column is connected to the item on the right side of the column.
          Here is the output file:
